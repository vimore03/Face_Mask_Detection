# Face_Mask_Detection

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Face Mask Dataset** available on Kaggle. It consists of images of individuals in two categories:

- People **wearing a mask**.
- People **not wearing a mask**.

### Data Source
- **Kaggle Dataset URL**: [Face Mask Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset)

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For scripting and data processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **Kaggle API**: For downloading the dataset.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Download and Preprocessing**: Load images and labels, resize images, and prepare data for training.
2. **Model Building**: Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images.
3. **Model Training**: Train the model using the preprocessed dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on test data.
5. **Prediction**: Implement a system to predict mask usage in new images.
